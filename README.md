# LINK TO FILE SHARING WEBSITE #

This is the link to the login page for our file sharing website:
http://ec2-107-22-153-209.compute-1.amazonaws.com/~alexcort/login.html

# USERS #

You can log in as alex, everett, or eva... the list of users is in the users.txt file in the repo

# LOGIN #

Once you log in to a valid account, you will be notified and redirected if you try to log in with a user that does not exist,
you will be presented with a list of that users files some users have some files that we put in, some are empty

# DOWNLOAD/VIEW FILE #

If you click on a file we made it so that the file will download and you can then open the file from
your downloads folder. This works with all types of documents.

# UPLOAD FILE #

you have the option to upload a file, they can be of many extensions, but you cannot upload files with
certain characters in them, and we will redirect you to the same page if there are any errors in the Filename
that you uploaded

# DELETE FILE #

you need to type the name of the file, that appears above, in the text box and click delete to delete the file. The page will
auto update, but if you try and delete a file that does not exist you will be redirected to an error page and back to
the main user interface

# CREATIVE PORTION - SENDING FILES #

you are able to send files to other users on the website. The same as delete type in the file that you wish to send and
the user that you wish to send it to (everett, alex, eva). If you enter an invalid file or a non existent user you will be
sent to an error page and redirected to the main page. You will not be able to send a file to yourself. You also can send as
many duplicates as you want, but only one copy will be created in the user's directory that you sent it to.

# CREATIVE PORTION - REDIRECT PAGES #

we created redirect pages to show the user when there are errors and send him back to the page he was previously on. We also redirect for certain successes like sending a file to a user, but not with upload/delete because you dynamically will see
your list of files update but would not be able to see say alex's files from everett's account.
